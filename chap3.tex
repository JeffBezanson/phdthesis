\section{The language design space}

It is helpful to begin with a rather coarse classification of programming
languages, according to how expressive their type systems are, and whether
their type systems are dynamic or static:

\vspace{3ex}

\begin{tabular}{|c||c|c|}
\hline 
 & More types & Fewer types\tabularnewline
\hline 
\hline 
Dynamic & Dylan, Julia & Scheme, Python, MATLAB\tabularnewline
\hline 
Static & ML, Haskell, Scala & Fortran, Pascal, C\tabularnewline
\hline 
\end{tabular}

\vspace{3ex}


The lower right corner tends to contain older languages. The upper right corner
contains many popular ``dynamic'' languages. The lower left corner contains
many modern languages resulting from research on static type systems.
We are most interested in the upper left corner, which is notable for being
rather sparsely populated. It has been generally believed that dynamic
languages do not ``need'' types, or that there is no point in talking about
types if they are not going to be checked at compile time. These views have
some merit, but as a result the top-left corner of this design space has
been seriously under-explored.

\subsection{Classes vs.\ functions}

\subsection{Separate compilation vs.\ performance}

Writing the signature of a generic method that needs to be separately compiled,
as in Java for example, can be a difficult exercise.
The programmer must use the type system to write down sufficient conditions on all
arguments.
(TODO example from \cite{Garcia:2003:CSL:949305.949317})
If, however, we are going to specialize the method, the compiler can analyze it
using actual types from call sites, and see for itself whether the method works
in each case (this is how C++ templates are type-checked; they are analyzed
again for each instantiation).

It is quite interesting that performance and ease-of-use pull this design
decision in the same direction.

\subsection{Parametric vs.\  ad-hoc polymorphism}

\todo[inline]{Can we have a definition of ad-hoc polymorphism and talk
about its relation to multiple dispatch? and point to a technical computing example?}

The idea of specialization unites parametric and ad-hoc polymorphism.
Beginning with a parametrically-polymorphic function, one can imagine
a compiler specializing it for various cases, i.e.\ certain concrete argument
values. These specializations could be stored in a lookup table, for use
either at compile time or at run time.

Next we can imagine that the compiler might not optimally specialize
certain definitions, and that the programmer would like to provide
hints or hand-written implementations to speed up special cases.
For example, imagine a function that traverses a generic array. A compiler-generated
specialization might inline a specific array types's indexing operations, but a human
might further realize that the loop order should be switched for certain
arrays types based on their storage order.

However, if we are going to let a human specialize a function for performance,
we might as well allow them to specialize it for some other reason, including
entirely different behavior. But at this point separate ad-hoc polymorphism
is no longer necessary; we are using a single overloading feature for
everything.


Parametric polymorphism describes code that works for any object precisely
because it does not do anything meaningful to the object, for example the
identity function. In contrast, programming with tagged data (e.g.
symbolic expression systems, XML) permits code to work for any object
because every object has the same structure, allowing meaningful
operations.

\subsection{Static checking vs.\ flexibility}

\subsection{Modularity vs.\ large vocabularies}

In the context of software engineering, modularity is a primary concern.
To build large systems, separate components must be isolated to some
degree.
Reasons for this include simple concerns like avoiding name conflicts,
and a desire to separate interface from implementation to allow
a component to change without affecting the rest of the system.

Modularity is sometimes taken to an extreme, and one will see
fully qualified names like \texttt{org.jboss.annotation.ejb.cache.simple.CacheConfig}
(selected from the JBOSS Java APIs).

Technical computing languages have often avoided and discouraged such
designs. For example MATLAB for most of its history supported only a single
namespace, which comes pre-populated with thousands of functions.


\subsection{Eliminating vs.\ embracing tagged data}

\subsection{Data hiding vs.\ explicit memory layout}

Examples of CSC and CSR sparse representation.
In one sense this is a perfect example of an interface with multiple implementations,
and therefore a good use case for object-oriented programming.
However in the technical computing world, \emph{hiding} this difference in
representation is not usually considered desirable.
Clearly a sparse matrix class cannot contain all functions of matrices that users
might want to compute.
Yet when new functions are added, the programmer needs and wants to exploit
representation details (CSC or CSR) for performance.
The performance differences involved here are quite significant (TODO cite).

The loss of encapsulation due to multi-methods weighed in \cite{binarymethods}
is less of a problem for technical computing, and in some cases even
advantageous.

\subsection{Dynamic dispatch is key}

\todo[inline]{Comment: Really nice!}

It would be unpleasant if every piece of every program we wrote were forced
to do only one specific task. Every time we wanted to do something slightly
different, we'd have to write a different program. But if a language
allows the same program element to do different things at different times,
we can write whole classes of programs at once. This kind of capability is
one of the main reasons \emph{object-oriented} programming is popular: it
provides a way to automatically select different behaviors according to
some structured criteria.

In class-based OO there is essentially \emph{no way} to create an operation
that dispatches on existing types (the expression problem \cite{wadler1998expression}).
This clearly
does not match technical computing, where most programs deal with the same
few types (e.g. number, array), and might sensibly want to write new operations
that dispatch on them.

%Somewhat unfortunately, the term \emph{object-oriented} has many
%connotations, and the \emph{object-oriented} methodology tries to address
%multiple software engineering problems --- for example modularity,
%encapsulation, implementation hiding, and code reuse. These issues are
%important, but it may be because of them that over time too little
%emphasis has been placed on expressive power.

We use the non-standard term ``criteria'' deliberately, in order
to clarify our point of view, which is independent of any particular
object system.

The sophistication of the available ``selection criteria'' account for a
large part of the perceived ``power'' or leverage provided by a language.
In fact it is possible to illustrate a hierarchy of such mechanisms.
As an example, consider a simple simulation, and how it can be written
under a series of increasingly powerful paradigms. First, written-out
imperative code:

\begin{singlespace}
\begin{verbatim}
while running
    for a in animals
        b = nearby_animal(a)
        if a isa Rabbit
            if b isa Wolf then run(a)
            if b isa Rabbit then mate(a,b)
        else if a isa Wolf
            if b isa Rabbit then eat(a,b)
            if b isa Wolf then follow(a,b)
        end
    end
end
\end{verbatim}
\end{singlespace}

We can see how this would get tedious as we add more kinds of animals
and more behaviors. Another problem is that the animal behavior is
implemented directly inside the control loop, so it is hard to see
what parts are simulation control logic and what parts are animal
behavior. Adding a simple object system leads to a nicer implementation
\footnote{A perennial problem with simple examples is that better
implementations often make the code longer.}:

\begin{singlespace}
\begin{verbatim}
class Rabbit
    method encounter(b)
        if b isa Wolf then run()
        if b isa Rabbit then mate(b)
    end
end

class Wolf
    method encounter(b)
        if b isa Rabbit then eat(b)
        if b isa Wolf then follow(b)
    end
end

while running
    for a in animals
        b = nearby_animal(a)
        a.encounter(b)
    end
end
\end{verbatim}
\end{singlespace}

Here all of the simulation's animal behavior has been essentially
compressed into a single program point: \texttt{a.encounter(b)}
leads to all of the behavior by selecting an implementation based
on the first argument, \texttt{a}. This kind of criterion is
essentially indexed lookup; we can imagine that \texttt{a} is
simply an integer index into a table of operations.

The next enhancement to ``selection criteria'' adds a hierarchy
of behaviors, to provide further opportunities to avoid
repetition:

\todo[inline]{has  $<:$  been defined yet?}

\begin{singlespace}
\begin{verbatim}
abstract class Animal
    method nearby()
        # search within some radius
    end
end

class Rabbit <: Animal
    method encounter(b: Animal)
        if b isa Wolf then run()
        if b isa Rabbit then mate(b)
    end
end

class Wolf <: Animal
    method encounter(b: Animal)
        if b isa Rabbit then eat(b)
        if b isa Wolf then follow(b)
    end
end

while running
    for a in animals
        b = a.nearby()
        a.encounter(b)
    end
end
\end{verbatim}
\end{singlespace}

We are still essentially doing table lookup, but the tables have
more structure: every \texttt{Animal} has the \texttt{nearby}
method, and can inherit a general-purpose implementation.

This brings us roughly to the level of most popular object-oriented
languages. But in this example still more can be done. Notice that
in the first step to objects we replaced one level of \texttt{if}
statements with method lookup. However, inside of these methods
a structured set of \texttt{if} statements remains. We can
replace these by adding another level of dispatch.

\begin{singlespace}
\begin{verbatim}
class Rabbit <: Animal
    method encounter(b: Wolf) = run()
    method encounter(b: Rabbit) = mate(b)
end

class Wolf <: Animal
    method encounter(b: Rabbit) = eat(b)
    method encounter(b: Wolf) = follow(b)
end
\end{verbatim}
\end{singlespace}

We now have a \emph{double dispatch} system, where a method call
uses two lookups, first on the first argument and then on the
second argument.

This syntax might be considered a bit nicer, but the design
clearly begs a question: why is $n=2$ special? It isn't, and we
could clearly consider even more method arguments as part of
dispatch. But at that point, why is the first argument special?
Why separate methods in a special way based on the first argument?
It seems arbitrary, and indeed we can remove the special treatment:

\begin{singlespace}
\begin{verbatim}
abstract class Animal
end

class Rabbit <: Animal
end

class Wolf <: Animal
end

nearby(a: Animal) = # search
encounter(a: Rabbit, b: Wolf) = run(a)
encounter(a: Rabbit, b: Rabbit) = mate(a,b)
encounter(a: Wolf, b: Rabbit) = eat(a, b)
encounter(a: Wolf, b: Wolf) = follow(a, b)

while running
    for a in animals
        b = nearby(a)
        encounter(a, b)
    end
end
\end{verbatim}
\end{singlespace}

Here we made two major changes: the methods have been moved ``outside''
of any classes, and all arguments are listed explicitly. This change
has fairly significant implications. Since methods no longer need to be
``inside'' classes, there is no syntactic limit to where definitions
may appear. Now it is easier to add new methods after a class has
been defined. Methods also now naturally operate on combinations of
objects, not single objects.

The shift to thinking about combinations of objects is fairly
revolutionary. Many interesting properties only apply to combinations
of objects, and not individuals. We are also now free to think of
more exotic kinds of combinations.

We can define a method on \emph{any number} of objects:

\begin{verbatim}
encounter(ws: Wolf...) = pack(ws)
\end{verbatim}

\todo[inline]{We can also do diagonal dispatch:}

\begin{verbatim}
encounter{T<:Animal}(a: T, b: T) = mate(a, b)
\end{verbatim}



\section{Multiple dispatch}

% CHART of different multiple dispatches. classify them

%Why ``just overloading'' is not enough. You intercept every operation and
%rewrite it, kind of an escape hatch for a language you don't like. If
%somebody else also tries to do this, there won't necessarily be any
%coherence.

A helpful way to classify languages with some kind of generic programming
support is to look at which language constructs are generic. For example,
in C++ the syntax \texttt{object.method(x)} is generic: a programmer can
get it to do different things by supplying different values for
\texttt{object}. The C++ syntax \texttt{f(a,b)} or \texttt{a+b} is
usually not generic, but can be overloaded by supplying definitions for
different argument types. However, this overloading only uses compile-time
types (no run-time information), and so is essentially a form of renaming ---
it can be implemented by renaming each definition with a unique name, and
replacing overloaded calls with an appropriate name based on compile-time
types. This is a much weaker form of generic programming, since different
behaviors cannot be obtained by passing different values at run time.

For this reason, C++ programs are not fully generic: it is difficult to
substitute new behaviors for every part of a program. Some languages
take generic programming much further. For example, in MATLAB, \emph{every}
function is effectively generic, and can be overloaded by new classes.
This enables a programmer to ``intercept'' every function call (and therefore,
essentially everything a program does)


\subsection{Example: lattices}

This example will illustrate possible benefits of multiple dispatch and
dynamic typing for mathematical computing.
The benefits are not absolute, but notational and semantic:
they involve code size and clarity, and the extent to which the entities
provided by the language match a mental model of the domain.

A \emph{lattice} is an algebraic structure where some pairs of elements
satisfy a reflexive, antisymmetric, and transitive relation $\leq$.
For purposes of this example, we will consider lattices that have
a greatest, or \emph{top}, element ($\top$), and a least, or \emph{bottom}
element ($\bot$). When working with lattices one often wants to compute
a least upper bound, or \emph{join} ($\sqcup$), or a greatest lower bound,
or \emph{meet} ($\sqcap$).

Several interesting concerns arise when modeling lattices in a programming
language. First, the structure is very general, and so admits implementations
for many different kinds of elements. We want to write code using
the operators $\leq$, $\sqcup$, and $\sqcap$, and have it apply to any kind
of lattice. Therefore some kind of overloading or object-oriented programming
is desirable. Second, some properties apply to all lattices, and we would
like to avoid implementing them repeatedly.

Using ``duck typing'', the problem of modeling an abstraction like lattices
disappears almost entirely. One may simply define methods for
$\leq$, $\sqcup$, and $\sqcap$ at any time, for any type, and that type will
function as a lattice. That is certainly convenient, but it also fails to
provide any reusable functionality for those defining lattices.



\begin{figure}
\todo[inline]{what does $===$ mean here?}

by objects that will be used primarily as elements of some lattice.
The library also provides standard

\subsection{Symbolic programming}

There has always been an essential divide between ``numeric'' and ``symbolic''
languages in the world of technical computing. To many people the
distinction is fundamental, and we should happily live with both
kinds of languages. But if one insists on an answer as to which approach
is the right one, then the answer is: \todo{Love it!}  symbolic.

Systems based on symbolic rewrite rules arguably occupy a further tier of
dispatch sophistication. In these systems, you can dispatch on essentially
anything, including arbitrary values and structures. These systems are
typically powerful enough to concisely define the kinds of behaviors we
are interested in.

However, symbolic programming lacks data abstraction: the concrete
representations of values are exposed to the dispatch system
(e.g. there is no difference between being a list and being something
represented as a list).

\subsection{Predicate dispatch}

%Patterns are very powerful, but the tradeoff is that there is not
%necessarily a useful relationship between what your program does and
%what a static analysis (based on a finite-height partial order over
%patterns) can discover. Maybe julia could be considered a sweet spot
%somewhere in between.

Predicate dispatch is a powerful object-oriented mechanism that allows
methods to be selected based on arbitrary predicates \cite{ErnstKC98}.
It is, in some
sense, the most powerful \emph{possible} dispatch system, since any
computation may be done as part of method selection. Since a predicate
denotes a set (the set of values for which it is true), it also denotes
a set-theoretic type. Some type systems of this kind, notably that of
Common Lisp \cite{steele1990common:types}, have actually included predicates as types.
However, such a type system is obviously undecidable, since it
requires computing the predicates themselves or, even worse, computing
predicate implication.
\footnote{
Many type systems involving bounded quantification, such as system $F_{<:}$,
are already undecidable \cite{Pierce1994131}.
However, they seem to terminate for most practical programs, and also admit
minor variations that yield decidable systems \cite{Castagna:1994:DBQ:174675.177844}.
It is fair to say they are ``just barely'' undecidable, while predicates
are ``very'' undecidable.
}

For a language that is willing to do run-time type checks anyway, the
undecidability of predicate dispatch is not a problem.
Interestingly, it can also pose no problem for \emph{static} type systems
that wish to prove that every call site has an applicable method.
Even without evaluating predicates, one can prove that the available methods
are exhaustive (e.g. methods for both $p$ and $\neg p$ exist).
In contrast, and most relevant to this thesis, predicate types \emph{are} a
problem for code \emph{specialization}. Static method lookup would require
evaluating the predicates, and optimal code generation would require
understanding something about what the predicates mean. One approach would
be to include a list of satisfied predicates in a type. However, to the
extent such a system is decidable, it is essentially equivalent to multiple
inheritance. Another approach would be to separate predicates into a
second ``level'' of the type system. The compiler would combine methods
with the same ``first level'' type, and then generate branches to evaluate
the predicates. Such a system would be very useful, and could be
% TODO cite, as this has probably been done
combined with a language like Julia or, indeed, most object-oriented
languages. However this comes at the expense of conceding that predicates
are not ``real'' types.

In considering the problems of predicate dispatch for code specialization,
we seem to be up against a fundamental obstacle: some sets of values are
simply more robust under evaluation than others. Programs that map integers
to integers abound, but programs that map, say, even integers to even
integers are rare to the point of irrelevance.


\section{Domain theory}

In the 1960s Dana Scott asked how to assign meanings to programs,
which otherwise just appear to be lists of symbols.
For example, given a program computing the factorial function, we
want a process by which we can assign the meaning ``factorial'' to it.
This led to the invention of domain theory, which can be interpreted
as modeling the behavior of a program without running it.
A ``domain'' in this theory is a
partial order of sets of values that a program might manipulate. 
Domain theory models computation as follows: a program starts with no
information, the lowest point in the partial order (``bottom'').
Computation steps accumulate information, gradually moving higher through
the order. The advantage of this model, in essence, is that it provides a
way to think about the meaning of a program without running the program.
Even the ``result'' of a non-terminating program has a representation ---
the bottom element. Other elements of the partial order might refer to
intermediate results.

Domain theory gave rise to the study of denotational semantics and the
design of type systems. However, the original theory is quite general
and invites us to invent any domains we wish for any sort of language.
For example, given a program that outputs an integer, we might decide
that we only care whether this integer is even or odd. Then our posets
are the even and odd integers, and we will classify operations in the
program according to whether they are evenness-preserving and so on.
Abstract interpretation \cite{abstractinterp} is an especially
elegant and general implementation of this idea.
It should be clear that this sort of analysis, while clearly related
to type systems, is fairly different from what most programmers
think of as type \emph{checking}.


\subsection{Monotonicity}

Functions of types are not monotonic. \texttt{isa(2,3)} is \texttt{false},
but \texttt{isa(2,Int)} is \texttt{true}.
This provides one way to separate ``real types'' from set-valued terms:
if there is a way to interpret execution over types such that all functions
are monotonic in the (alleged) type lattice, then we are really dealing
with types.
One way to do this is to specify a genuinely multi-valued term language
like $\lambda_\aleph$ \cite{Glew:2013:MLD:2502409.2502412}.
In this approach a term like \texttt{isa(2,Int)} is interpreted as a
union of all results obtained by substituting all possible single values
for each sub-term. One cannot help but be impressed by such a language,
though it seems prohibitively difficult to actually implement.
%$\lambda_\aleph$ was introduced a couple years after we began work on Julia
We opt instead for a simpler approach where \texttt{Int} is
interpreted as \texttt{Type\{Int\}} (in a near-borrowing of notation from
\cite{Glew:2013:MLD:2502409.2502412} and \cite{cardelli1986polymorphic}),
and multi-valued terms exist only statically within a separate
maximum-fixed-point evaluator.

\section{Subtyping}

Something about semantic subtyping and type systems for processing XML.
XML at first seems unrelated to numerical computing, and indeed it
was quite a while before we discovered these papers and noticed the
overlap. However if one substitutes ``symbolic expression'' for
``XML document'', the similarity becomes clearer.
